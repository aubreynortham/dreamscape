## Welcome to Dreamscape!
Dreamscape is a dream-tracking app built with Ruby on Rails. For this project, I wanted to create a full-stack app that I would find useful in my own life, and it was fun working toward something that I would actually enjoy using every day.

This app is structured with three models: users, dreams, and tags nested within dreams. RESTful routes were used throughout, along with error-handling and validation for a user-friendly experience. For a quick demo of the full functionality, check out my screencast below, and the wireframes, ERD plans, and user stories can be accessed in the planning folder of this repo.

### Followup Features:
With more time to revisit this project, there are several additional features and improvements I hope to implement. I'd like to include an option allowing for users to opt for a private account, where their dream entries are not automatically entered into the publicly accessible "Collective" which is currently the default. I'd also like to go back and create the functionality to sort all dreams by tag. In general, I want to use media queries to perfectly optimize this app for mobile use - because that is the platform that most early-morning-dream-recorders would likely prefer. A long-term goal would be to integrate this app with iOS or Android alarm clock functionality, so that the process of waking up and recording your dream becomes a one-step process.
